Consider a typical Roof, Long, Interior side beam. From analysis in SAP2000, the beam was found to experience a maximum moment of $213.2528$. The depth $d$ of the Whitney Stress Block can be found with the following equation:
 d = \frac{\phi M_{n}{{\phi A_{s} f_{y}} + \frac{a}{2} = \frac{\phi (2559033.6)}{0.9*(3.81)*(60000)} + \frac{3.586}{2} = 26.80949542
