Consider a typical Roof, Short, Exterior side beam. From analysis in SAP2000, the beam was found to experience a maximum moment of $-3.7634$. The depth $d$ of the Whitney Stress Block can be found with the following equation:
 d = \frac{\phi M_{n}{{\phi A_{s} f_{y}} + \frac{a}{2} = \frac{\phi (45160.8)}{0.9*(3.81)*(60000)} + \frac{0.963978495}{2} = 2.257617284
