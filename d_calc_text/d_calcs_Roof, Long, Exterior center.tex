Consider a typical Roof, Long, Exterior center beam. From analysis in SAP2000, the beam was found to experience a maximum moment of $110.6816$. The depth $d$ of the Whitney Stress Block can be found with the following equation:
 d = \frac{\phi M_{n}{{\phi A_{s} f_{y}} + \frac{a}{2} = \frac{\phi (1328179.2)}{0.9*(3.81)*(60000)} + \frac{2.298717949}{2} = 14.81375404
